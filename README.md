# Term integration project - Dash

We've already seen some Dash examples and how it works in
[session-7][session-7], in this session we'll try to cover more
specific questions about plotting data with Dash, integrating it with
Flask, etc.

## More interesting components

In the `components.py` file you can see an example of a more
interesting use of components.  We're mixing up a couple of different
components for querying data in our Dataframe, a multi-dropdown that
we already know and a range slider.

## Routing in Dash

In `routing.py` we're demonstrating how routing is possible directly
within dash, so that we can change what we render in a page depending
on the URL.

## Integrating Dash with Flask

In the last example, `dash_in_flask.py`, we see how we can integrate a
Dash app with an existing Flask app.
